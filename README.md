# ECE 1718 Project automated script

The goal of this script is to automate daily use cases. We plan to do the following:

* Browse 12 webpages (1 minute each)
* Watch a YouTube Video (12 minutes)
* Auto typing in Word (12 minutes)
* Zoom meeting (12 minutes)
* WeChat (12 minutes)

And we need to implement tools to watch frequency and power consumption.
